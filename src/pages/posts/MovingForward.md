&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last part of this three part Intro series about me. I wrote these posts with the intention of putting myself out in this digital world, and showcasing my skills. This post will be about where I'am at, what I've accomplished, and my goals for the future. 

For the past couple of years, the news have been dramatic to say the least. Right now, tech layoffs are taking over the headlines which is making me feel very anxious about landing a job in software engineering after 8 years of working as an architect. I will be soon joining the layoffs numbers, despite having accomplished an exponential growth in architecture, but I'm hopeful that I will find a place where I can continue growing and accomplishing goals.

### Speaking of accomplishments... ###

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm trilingual — I'm obviously writing in English, my native language is Spanish (Mexico), and I speak Japanese after living there for about three years. Language is a theme, and I've found similarities in coding. For example, you have to find ways to get your point across (problem-solving), pay **attention to detail**, and **logical thinking**. It also helps improve collaboration and understanding, and lead to more successful projects. Having a diverse cultural background is a huge plus too, especially for today's globalized world.

I have a diverse employment background. I started off with helping my mom with her restaurant on the weekends as a cashier and customer service, which is probably the hardest job I've had so far. I've done eight years in architecture in the United States, where I learned not only a new measurement system, but also strict building **regulations, processes, codes and laws**. I became familiar with the ADA code for accessibility pertaining to the built environment and advocate for its importance to my peers and clients. 

I've written a Modular Construction and Real Estate Development guides for marketing purposes under my current employer. I was able to accomplish these **documentation** examples due to my experience in multi-unit construction (60 apartments in Hayward, and 88 modular apartments in Oakland), where I was on the front-lines managing the project from the Architect's side.

### Future goals ###

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe 2023 to be a transformative year. I'm committed to pursue a path in software engineering and bringing more of my values and both personal and professional experiences to this goal and into my confidence. I want to set myself and my family for financial safety, and maintaining consistency and discipline in taking care of my physical and mental health. 

After graduating a six month program from General Assembly, I've found it difficult to focus on what to learn next given the overwhelming amount of information online and the application process to land that first job. Luckily, I have found motivation in community — my friends in the industry, my peers in the GA cohort, my partner, and even strangers online that have celebrated my accomplishment and root for me.

I have interest in web accessibility, queer visibility, and equality. I'm very happy to see the gaming industry pushing for more than minimum standards in a couple of recent games I've played. Overall, I aim to help other more directly. 

### Wrapping up ###
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this series, you may have seen how my personal values, experiences, and passions all played a role in shaping who I am as a person. They have shaped my worldview and my approach to life, and have helped me to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come my way.

I hope that by sharing my story, I have been able to give you a glimpse into who I am as a person, and that you have been able to relate to some of the things I have shared. My journey is ongoing, and I will continue to grow and evolve, but I am confident that I'm heading in the right direction. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to continuing to share my journey with you in the future.
