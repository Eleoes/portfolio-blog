**--**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom had this theory that Japanese would become the most spoken language besides English back in the 90s / early 2000s (spoiler alert: turned out to be Mandarin Chinese) so she had me enrolled in a couple of Japanese classes on 4th grade. For my second year in high school, I took her word and enrolled in an exchange student program to live one year in Japan as a student. 
<br>
<br>
By that time, it was probably clear that Mandarin was taking over, and I had forgotten everything from my classes, so why Japan? 
<br>
<br>
Well, why not? I wanted to experience something very unique. "BuT eVeRy pLAce iS UNiqUe", that might be true to you, but 16 year old Leo had spent the past 12 years of his life learning about European history, so visiting another Western city was out of the question, and Mandarin is **hard**.

Before I mention anything further, none of this could've been possible without my mom. She worked very hard and never tried to stop her only child to hop on a plane alone and sending him across the Pacific Ocean to live with a host-family for a whole year. **Te quiero mucho, ma!**

This family welcomed me with the most kindness, love and patience I could've ever hoped for.

### The language ###
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese has three writing systems (hiragana, katakana, and kanji), and complex grammar rules. Luckily for me being Mexican, the phonetics in speaking it were the same as Spanish. Japan is not a country were English is popularly spoken, so I did not have many comforts to resort to.  

Venturing the local stores, hanging out with classmates, and having breakfast and dinner together with my host-family were key factors in my learning of the language. Even now, 14 years later, I can still handle a casual conversation; but, the road was not easy. 

There were times when I felt very lonely, disconnected, and, of course, misunderstood. I had to remember what I was here for: to experience the unique culture of this country.  

I believe that through patience, kindness, and curiosity you can also achieve the same results. 

### The architecture ###
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese architecture and living in Japan had a profound impact on my decision to pursue a career in architecture. The country's unique blend of traditional and modern design, as well as its emphasis on harmony with nature, deeply resonated with me. This wasn't necessarily something I noticed while I was there. I think it wasn't until I came back to Mexico that I noticed its absence.

One of the most striking examples of this is the way traditional Japanese homes are designed to seamlessly blend in with nature. The use of sliding doors, or shoji, allows for a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor spaces, while the incorporation of gardens and courtyards brings the beauty of nature into the home.

In addition to the architectural design, I was also deeply impressed by the way that Japanese culture values simplicity and minimalism. This is reflected in the clean, uncluttered lines of traditional Japanese buildings, as well as in the use of natural materials and a limited color palette. This approach to design has greatly influenced my own aesthetic, and I strive to incorporate these same principles in my own work.

All of these experiences and observations made me realize that architecture is more than just creating buildings, it is about creating spaces that enhance the well-being of the people who use them, and that is what made me pursue a career in architecture.

### An afterword ###

I could write about Japan all day, but for now and especially for this Intro post, I hope this gives you an idea of how important Japanese culture is to me. And I get so excited to go back and visit every time I think of it.
