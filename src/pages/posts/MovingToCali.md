Welcome to _Chilaquiles Verdes_ ! Here, you hopefully find some cheer in my Mexican humor or at least find something to talk to me about. 

**--**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California wasn't exactly on the list of places to visit, or move to, after graduating from undergrad. I didn't have a specific place in mind but I definitely wanted to move out of Mexico. I needed a place for my queer self to feel safe and to be financially independent. 
It's now 8 years since I moved here to the Bay Area, and it's been an incredible experience. 
<br>

### First Impressions ###

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first things that struck me was getting out of 12th St BART station and seeing all the tall buildings in Downtown Oakland. And, of course, smelling **weed** in the air. 

Coming from Mexico, **public transportation** and walkability here were a breath of fresh air. Special shoutout to the bus system for their cleanliness and accessibility. 

Lastly, I was surprised by the **diversity of people**. I knew very little about the Bay Area, much less about Oakland, so knowing it was an American city further north from the border with Mexico I assumed that minorities would be less visible. I'd say the sense of community was stronger back then than now; however, the local people and those that support them, are very resilient in preserving the heritage that they've built.  
<br>

### My challenges ###

Oakland, like many cities in California and in the world, has its fair shares of challenges and issues. These are some of the challenges I've personally faced so far:

1.  Lack of affordable housing: I was couch surfing for a couple of months until I was able to rent a mattress in someone's living room. Eventually, I found a room for myself at the sweet cost of $1,250 USD a month.

2.  Getting mugged at gun point for the first time: The stigmatization of Mexico may tell you that this would've happened to me by now. It was a terrifying experience and happened right as I entered to my apartment complex. I lost $20 USD I had in cash at the time, but walked away with my life. 

3.  Undervaluing myself: This one took me some time to notice, but I have to remind myself that I'm enough.
