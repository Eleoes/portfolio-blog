# My personal website

Hi! I originally made this static website in React. After looking into [Astro](https://astro.build/), and playing around with it, I decided to refactor my website and add a blog with it!

## Technologies used

- Astro 1.9.0
- Astro islands: React
- Javascript
- CSS3
- HTML5

## Credits

Except for the blog itself, this is an open sourced website design I found online where I adjusted certain elements and style to match my aesthetic.
